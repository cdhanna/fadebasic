_Fade Basic_ was heavily inspired from _Dark Basic Pro_, created by _The 
Game Creators_. Most of _Fade Basic_ is directly copied from _Dark Basic 
Pro_. However, there are a few critical differences between the two 
languages. If you are familiar with _Dark Basic Pro_, please read the 
following change list so that you are aware of behavioural differences. 


## No Pointers

## Return User Defined Types from Functions

## Functions Don't Explode

## More Type Inference (common return type)

## No String Concatenation with semicolons
